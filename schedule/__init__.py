"""
The `schedule` app provides models, views and services related
to the URY radio schedule and retrieving portions of it.

In addition, `schedule` contains and exposes the *show database*,
or the collection of all shows, seasons and timeslots URY manages.

It is also responsible for providing schedule-related information to
other apps: the page header at time of writing embeds a ``schedule``
view in order to provide information about the up-coming shows.
